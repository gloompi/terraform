/**
* Output in your Terraform project shows a piece of data after Terraform successfully completes.
* Outputs are useful as they allow you to echo values from the Terraform run to the command line.
* For example, if you are creating an environment and setting up a bastion jump box as part of that environment,
* itâ€™s handy to be able to echo the public IP address of the newly created bastion to the command line.
* Then, after the terraform apply finishes, you are given the IP of the newly created bastion which is
* ready for you to ssh straight onto it.
