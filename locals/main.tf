/**
* A local is Terraformâ€™s representation of a normal programming language variable.
* Confusingly, Terraform also has a concept called a variable which is really
* an input (variables are covered in the variables chapter). A local can refer to a fixed value such as a string,
* or it can be used to refer to an expression such as two other locals concatenated together.
